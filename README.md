# Enigma Bruteforcer

This is a personal tool I use to bruteforce the decryption of Enigma ciphers, emphasizing speed. It's functional, but not yet in a polished library form. Expect frequent breakage until published as a library. The code has reached fair performance (1.77 x 10^6 decryptions/sec with scoring, 115 characters, Core i7-6500U, 4 threads), so I decided to release it in alpha form as I continue to improve it.
